# Who's That Pokemon?
This will take everyone back to the good old days, the 90s. I wanted to create something using the pokeapi.co API, so I made a game to test your Pokemon knowledge. Chose your favorite generation, start guessing Pokemon, and get a high score!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The Pokemon are pulled from the pokeapi.co API randomly and by selected generation. The silhouette is just some simple css.


## Lessons Learned:

I wanted to make a game that utilized local storage to learn more about it and so users could come back and try and beat their previous high score. This project was also good help with bolstering my API familiarity.
